# Mercenaries
Mercenaries is a tactical spin-off of Team Fortress 2, blending the class-based gameplay of TF2 with a slower, more methodical pace and deathmatch-style gunplay. Players choose from a reduced set of versatile classes, customize their loadouts with credits earned in-game, and engage in high-stakes combat with an emphasis on teamwork, positioning, and firepower.
